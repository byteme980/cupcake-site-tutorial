# Cupcake Website Tutorial

## About
I collaborated with some friends on creating this tutorial walkthrough for high school students to learn the basics of web development.

## Who's it for?

The tutorial was intended to take 1.5 hours and the content is geared at students who have no coding background whatsoever.

## How to use
Give a presentation to introduce basic HTML/CSS concepts. Then walk students through updating this code.

## Structure
* home.html - The HTML file; the bulk of the work happens here
* styles.css - The site's CSS styles
* assets/ - ColorPalette and FontPalette have web-safe colors and fonts that students can reference, and icons for facebook, twitter, and instagram
* images/ - contains a bunch of fun images students can use to fill out their stie  
* order.js - A simple JS file that shows an order confirmation temporarily; students will not need to edit this.

## How to teach with this tutorial
* Make sure each student has a computer with this repo open in a text editor - e.g. Sublime or Atom.
* Walk through the steps in this README. Changes will be made in home.html and styles.css
